"""Fat publish receiver for working around caching issues with the demo hub.

This isn't part of the PubSubHubbub spec. We have no intentions of making it to
be part of the spec. This extension hook is useful for publishers who want to
try out the PubSubHubbub protocol without building or running their own hub at
first. Receiving fat publish events directly from publishers allows the Hub to
work around any replication/caching delays that are described in this wiki entry
(see the section on multiple datacenters):

  http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/wiki/PublisherEfficiency

To enable this module, symlink this 'fat_publish.py' file into the 'hooks'
directory of the hub application; then put your shared secret into the
'fat_publish_secret.txt' file in the 'hooks' directory.

To use this module as a client, send POST requests with the parameters
'topic', 'content', and 'signature'. They should look like this:

  POST /fatping HTTP/1.1
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  Content-Length: ...

  topic=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fmytopic&\
  content=<url escaped feed contents>&\
  signature=<hmac signature of content and topic concatenated">
"""
