PubSubHubbub Hub Test Suite
---------------------------

This suite is intended to be used for hub compliancy. The test examples came 
directly from the current 0.1 PubSubHubbub Core working draft. However, not 
everything can be tested currently. This may change as the spec changes.

This requires Ruby, RSpec and Mechanize, the later two can be installed with 
Ruby Gems using "gem install rspec mechanize". RSpec is a great approach to 
testing and Ruby allows for nice DSL-like testing. The interface is HTTP, so 
it's language independent.

Using the Test Suite:

$ HUB_URL=<url to hub> spec hub_spec.rb --format specdoc

Example:

$ HUB_URL=http://localhost:8000 spec hub_spec.rb --format specdoc
